        "The WTA decoder does not really make great use of the encoding model. In fact, it doesn't really use it at all. If we would like to use our encoding model, we should make the following observation: our model tells us the probability of a neuron emitting a particular response, given an input location. That is, it gives us $P(c_i~|~\\mu_i,~x)$. Since we're assuming neural responses are independent, then the probability of the whole population response is just the product of the individual neural response probabilities: $P(\\vec{r}~|~\\vec{\\mu},~x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{21}P(c_i~|~\\mu_i,~x)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE), we are looking for the $x$ that maximizes the likelihood function -- i.e., the $x$ that has the highest $P(\\vec{r}~|~\\vec{\\mu},~x)$. There are a number of sophisticated ways we can find it (this is a field of research called \"optimization\"), but for now, we will do grid search. In grid search, we divide the stimulus domain into very small steps and then individually test each step to look for the best one.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, a note on implementation. When doing MLE we are looking for the maximizer $x$ of the likelihood function $P(\\vec{r}~|~\\vec{\\mu},~x) = \\prod_{i=1}^{21}P(c_i~|~\\mu_i,~x)$. In practice, we will often choose to find the maximizer $x$ of the **log** of the likelihood (log-likelihood). The reason for this is that in the standard likelihood computation, we have to compute this product $\\prod_{i=1}^{21}P(c_i~|~\\mu_i,~x)$ -- but unfortunately products of probabilities tend to get small very quickly and computers have issues dealing with very small quantities. Instead, taking the logarithm allows us to compute $\\log P(\\vec{r}~|~\\vec{\\mu},~x) = \\sum_{i=1}^{21}\\log P(c_i~|~\\mu_i,~x)$. Since this is a sum, and due to the properties of the logarithm function, the log-likelihood becomes small at a **much** slower rate than the standard likelihood function. Since the maximizer for both will be the same, in practice people almost always do MLE with the log-likelihood than the likelihood for non-trivial datasets. (Note, this is not a trivial idea, but it is an important practical one. If you don't understand why this works, you should try to figure it out by experimenting with some likelihood models and seeing what happens with a lot of data doing MLE over likelihood and log-likelihood.)

        "As stated earlier, bump attractor models are essentially models of place cells. However, let's say you wanted to create a **grid** cell network, in which there is not a singular bump of activity, but a set of multiple bumps with regular intervals between them. How would you adjust the connectivity kernel above in order to create this pattern of activity? You may answer this question by copying, pasting, and adjusting the code for `bump_synaptic_weights` or by writing below qualitatively.\n",

In this exercise, you will be exploring how to identify neurons in a tetrode recording through **spike sorting**. In addition, you will assess how the quality of your results depend on noise and the number of recording electrodes.\n",

        "You will now assess the effect of noise on the quality of your spike sorting. (1) Write a function called \"analyze_noise\" that takes an array of noise levels `(np.linspace(0.005, 0.4, 6))` and returns a metric that quantifies the grouping quality. (2) Plot that metric as a function of different noise levels. (3) Your function should also generate a plot of the color-coded waveforms and PC1/2 for each noise level (or call a second function that makes those plots).\n",

In addition, reducing the dimensionality of your data (to say, 2 dimensions) will help you directly observe how noise infleunces your clusters. \n",

In other words, extract \"starts\" from generateRecords and \"spikeTimes\" from segmentSpikes for the lowest noise case. For all subsequent noise levels, feed \"starts\" into generateRecords and \"spikeTimes\" into segmentSpikes. \n"
